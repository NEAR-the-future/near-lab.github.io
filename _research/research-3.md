At the **NEAR Lab**, our research centers on **neuro-embodied adaptive robotics**—robotic systems in which intelligence emerges from the interaction between **neural mechanisms, physical bodies, and the environment**.

We pursue an integrated approach spanning **robot design, modeling, control, and learning**, with an emphasis on **real-world embodiment** and **lifelong adaptation**.

## Ongoing & Future Directions

Our research continues to expand toward:
- tight integration of **neuromorphic hardware and robotic platforms**
- **co-design** of morphology, control, and learning mechanisms
- experimental studies of **development, adaptation, and evolution** in robots
